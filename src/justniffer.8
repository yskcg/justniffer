\fBExamples:\fP 
  Logging network traffic in Apache like format:
      \fBjustniffer -i eth0\fP 

  Tracing tcpdump dump in Apache like format:
      \fBjustniffer -f file.cap\fP 
  
  Tracing tcp streams from the network:
      \fBjustniffer -i eth0 -r\fP 

  Logging network traffic in Apache like format appending response times:
      \fBjustniffer -i eth0 -a " %response.time"\fP 

  Logging network traffic in a customized format:
      \fBjustniffer -i eth0 -l "%source.ip%tab%dest.ip%tab%request.header.host%tab%response.time"\fP

.SH DESCRIPTION
 \fBjustniffer\fP captures reassembles and reorders TCP packets, performs IP packet defragmentation and displays the tcp flow or part of it.
 It is useful for logging network traffic in a 'standard' (web server like) or in a customized way.
 It can log network services performances (e.g. web server response time , application server keep alive behaviour, etc.) .
 Output format can be customized using the log format option \fB-l\fP (see \fBFORMAT KEYWORDS\fP). 
 Most of them can be used for retrieving HTTP protocol informations. See \fBEXAMPLES\fP

.SH TRACKING PERFORMANCES

 The main feature of \fBjustniffer\fP is to analize network traffic to monitor performances. The perfomance related keywords are:
  %connection.time
  %idle.time.0
  %request.time
  %response.time
    %response.time.begin
    %response.time.end
  %idle.time.1

All request.header.* and response.header.* keywords can override the "not found string" passing it as parameter.
For example: 
 %request.header.host() will be replaced by the Host header value, or an empty string if Host header not found
 %request.header.host(UNKNOWN) will be replaced by the Host header value, or the UNKNOWN string if Host header not found
 %request.header.host will be replaced by the Host header value, or , if Host header not found, with the string specified by the \fB-n\fP option
